React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

    @vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
    @vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
To run this app on your local machine you can run this command on your terminal while in the directory of the app:


    npm install
